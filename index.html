  <pre>
In Formula 1, achieving peak performance on a circuit requires an understanding of the "optimal racing line," which is the trajectory that minimizes lap times, this line is influenced by aerodynamic forces, tire grip, weight distribution and track 
conditions. Understanding the racing line involves applying principles from physics including, equations of friction, motion and centripetal forces as well as analysing real-world data.

Formula 1 cars use the centripetal force to manoeuvre around turns at incredibly high speeds during a race. The inward force needed to maintain a Formula 1 car's motion along a curved trajectory is known as centripetal force. Without it, the car 
would continue to proceed in a straight path due to inertia, which would cause a collision. The magnitude of this force is given by F = mv^2/r. Where m, is the mass of the car, v is the velocity and r are the radius of the turn. From the diagram,
we can see the direction of the centripetal force is always perpendicular (at a right angle) to the direction to the car. Since it changes the velocity's direction instead of its magnitude, it’s always perpendicular therefore does not change the
speed. Centripetal force derives from the frictional contact between the tyres and the track surface. This force is dependent on both the normal force (N) and the coefficient of friction (μ) which can be seen from the equation: F = μN. 
This equation can also be further used in the deceleration forces and braking when taking these corners

    Not only does centripetal force matter but also the substantial downforce the cars generate which improves grip. The downforce (Fd) generated can be modelled as: Fd = ½ ρClAv^2. Where ρ is air density, Cl is lift coefficient, A is area of wing
    and v is velocity. To maintain higher speeds without exceeding beyond the car's traction limits, high-speed corners require a racing line that makes use of downforce. Maintaining that higher speed effectively reduces the amount of time spent in
    corners by minimising the need for wide entry or exits and sharp braking. Downforce also increases grip, but it also increases drag, reducing straight line speed. Engineers design cars to balance this trade-off depending on the tracks.
    However, the optimal line is also performing the perfect, corner entry, apex and exit speeds. This is sometimes why drivers sacrifice entry speed to achieve a higher apex and exit speed. Usually braking round corners, drivers experience forces
    up to 5g.  During the corner entry, the deceleration experienced is defined by Newton’s second law: F = ma, where F is the breaking force, m is the mass of the car and driver and a is the deceleration. SUVAT equations can show how f1 cars can
    perform the manoeuvres around the corner of a track. Initially the car reaches the corner and the driver must decelerate. The deceleration is defined by negative acceleration (a) and using the SUVAT equations: v^2 = u^2 + 2as. Where u is the
    velocity entering the braking zone, v is the velocity at the apex, s is the braking distance and a is the deceleration. Eventually reaching the end of the track the driver must then now accelerate to exit the turn at the highest speed possible.
    This phase can be shown by the equation v = u+at. Where v is the final velocity after exiting the corner, u is the initial velocity at the apex, a is the acceleration and t is the time to accelerate. Optimal racing line also typically relies on
    maximising speed and efficiency on straights. On any straight section of a track, it is to achieve the highest possible velocity. This can be seen on DRS (Drag reduction System) zones. DRS allows the driver to open the read wing of the car to
    reduce drag and increase top speed which helps them in overtaking manoeuvres. The car utilises less engine power to sustain high speeds due to DRS's ability to reduce drag, which can also help manage tyre wear and conserve fuel.
    However, DRS only beneficial in straights due to it sacrifices grip in corners. Therefore, the overall impact of DRS on race strategy depends on the circuit. Circuits with fewer straights are less advantageous than tracks with tight turns and
    longer straights. In this instance, engineers modify the car's aerodynamics prior to every race to maximise DRS's effectiveness while maintaining cornering performance.
